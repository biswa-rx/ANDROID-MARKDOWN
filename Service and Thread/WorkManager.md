# WORK MANAGERS
`WorkManager is part of the Android Jetpack architecture components and provides an easy and flexible way to schedule and manage deferrable background tasks. It handles various constraints, such as network availability, charging status, and device idle state, to execute tasks efficiently while respecting battery and system resources.`

1. Create a Worker class that extends Worker. This class contains the background work you want to execute.

```java
public class MyWorker extends Worker {

    public MyWorker(@NonNull Context context, @NonNull WorkerParameters workerParams) {
        super(context, workerParams);
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Result doWork() {
        // Add your background work here
        // For demonstration purposes, we'll simulate a task by delaying for 5 seconds
        try {
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        return Result.success();
    }
}

```

2. Schedule the work with constraints in your MainActivity or any other entry point.(Application class preferred)

```java
private void startBackgroundWork() {
        // Define the constraints for the work
        Constraints constraints = new Constraints.Builder()
                .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED) // Network constraint (optional)
                .setRequiresCharging(true) // Charging constraint (optional)
                .setRequiresDeviceIdle(true) // Idle constraint (optional)
                .build();

        // Create the WorkRequest and set the constraints
        OneTimeWorkRequest workRequest = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(MyWorker.class)
                .setConstraints(constraints)
                .build();

        // Enqueue the work to WorkManager
        WorkManager.getInstance(this).enqueue(workRequest);
    }
```

* Simplicity and Flexibility: WorkManager provides a simple and easy-to-use API for scheduling and executing background tasks. It allows you to define tasks with flexible constraints, such as network availability, charging status, and device idle state, making it easy to adapt your app's behavior based on the device's conditions.

* Battery and Performance Optimization: WorkManager is designed to optimize battery life and system resources. It intelligently schedules tasks to run at the most appropriate times, taking into account the device's current state and the constraints defined for each task. It batches similar tasks to run together, reducing the number of wake-ups and minimizing the impact on battery life.

* Guaranteed Execution: WorkManager provides "guaranteed" execution for tasks, ensuring that tasks will be executed even if the app is closed or the device is restarted. It uses Android's JobScheduler, Firebase JobDispatcher, or AlarmManager (depending on the device's API level) to handle task execution efficiently.

* Backward Compatibility: WorkManager works on devices running Android 5.0 (API level 21) and higher. It automatically selects the most appropriate and efficient underlying implementation based on the device's API level.

* Chain and Combine Tasks: WorkManager allows you to chain and combine multiple tasks easily. You can define complex work sequences and dependencies between tasks, making it straightforward to handle tasks that need to run in a specific order.

* Reliable Retry and Backoff Policies: If a task fails, WorkManager provides built-in retry and backoff policies, allowing you to specify how many times the task should be retried and with what delay between retries.

* Observability and Monitoring: WorkManager offers a powerful API to observe the status and progress of scheduled tasks. You can register observers to get updates on task execution and handle task completion or failure gracefully.

* Integration with LiveData and RxJava: WorkManager integrates well with LiveData and RxJava, allowing you to observe the task status using these reactive programming libraries.
